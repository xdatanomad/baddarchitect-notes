# Content Map

This file holds the planned content map for the site. It is not a draft backlog, article workspace, or loose idea dump.

## Planning Rules

- Keep the map short and focused on high-value content.
- Add planned content only when it has a clear reader, job-to-be-done, goal, and practical takeaway.
- Prefer decision rules, checklists, blueprints, operating models, and implementation paths over broad commentary.
- Challenge ideas that are generic, hype-driven, too broad, or not yet tied to the project quality bar.

## p1 Pillar 1: AI Adoption Stages & Challenges

### p1-01 The Demo Is Not the Product. The Workflow Is the Product.

- Reader/job: AI architects, CTOs, product leaders, and founders trying to move an impressive AI demo into a real deployed workflow.
- Evidence/resources: [McKinsey State of AI 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), [MIT NANDA GenAI Divide 2025](https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf), [Deloitte State of AI in the Enterprise 2026](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/about/press-room/state-of-ai-report-2026.html), [Gartner agentic AI cancellation prediction](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-gartner-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027), [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-bedrock-agentcore-securely-deploy-and-operate-ai-agents-at-any-scale/), [Microsoft Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/overview), [Google Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale), [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph), [Temporal durable execution](https://docs.temporal.io/).
- Goal: Show why AI products stall after the demo when teams solve model interaction but not workflow integration, context, memory, deployment, scale, and operational ownership.
- Outline:
  - Open with the core distinction: a demo answers a prompt; a product completes a workflow with state, systems of record, permissions, approvals, retries, and audit trails.
  - Combine workflow integration with context/memory: useful AI must know the customer, policy, past exceptions, current state, and what happened last time, not just retrieve generic documents.
  - Add the deployment and scale layer: many teams can build an agent locally, but struggle to run it reliably on company cloud/infra with observability, cost controls, secure tool access, secrets, versioning, rollback, and durable execution.
  - Discuss the emerging tool categories without overclaiming winners: managed cloud agent runtimes, agent orchestration frameworks, durable workflow engines, eval/observability platforms, and enterprise integration layers.
  - Practical takeaway: a "workflow readiness map" covering trigger, systems touched, required context, state, permissions, deployment target, failure modes, and measurable business outcome.

### p1-02 The Trust Factor: When Is an AI Agent Safe Enough for Customers?

- Reader/job: AI architects, product leaders, support leaders, and security reviewers deciding whether a working internal agent can be exposed directly to customers.
- Evidence/resources: [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework), [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications), [OWASP MCP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mcp-top-10/), [Gartner customer service AI pressure 2026](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2026-02-18-gartner-survey-finds-ninety-one-percent-of-customer-service-leaders-under-pressure-to-implement-ai-in-2026), [Verint State of Customer Experience 2026](https://www.verint.com/press-room/2026-press-releases/new-verint-survey-reveals-rising-customer-service-expectations/), [Metrigy consumer AI service survey 2026](https://www.metrigy.com/press-release-metrigy-study-85-of-consumers-prefer-interacting-with-humans-vs-ai-agents-for-customer-service/).
- Goal: Give teams a decision framework for the trust gap between "the agent works" and "the agent should speak or act on behalf of the company."
- Outline:
  - Start with the support-engineer robot example: the team built a useful support agent, but still debated whether it could directly respond to customer issues because customer-facing trust requires more than internal usefulness.
  - Combine reliability, permissions, evals, and security: the agent needs bounded data access, adversarial prompt handling, source-grounded answers, regression tests, tool-call controls, audit logs, escalation, and rollback.
  - Separate output trust from operational trust: being correct in test conversations is different from handling every customer input, every edge case, and every unsafe request in production.
  - Address customer acceptance: customers may tolerate AI for speed, routing, simple resolution, and status checks, but expect human access for complex, emotional, high-value, contractual, or unresolved issues.
  - Practical takeaway: a customer-exposure gate with four levels: internal assistant, human-reviewed draft, limited customer self-service, and autonomous customer response/action.

### p1-03 The ROI Reality Check: AI Unit Economics and the Moat Problem

- Reader/job: CTOs, founders, product leaders, and AI practice leaders deciding whether an AI product creates durable value or just expensive activity.
- Evidence/resources: [BCG The Widening AI Value Gap 2025](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/are-you-generating-value-from-ai-the-widening-gap), [BCG The AI-First SaaS Company 2026](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2026/the-ai-first-saas-company-rethinking-the-playbook), [Retool Build vs. Buy Report 2026](https://retool.com/newsroom/build-vs-buy-report-2026), [Bessemer AI Pricing Playbook 2026](https://www.bvp.com/assets/uploads/2026/02/The_AI_pricing_playbook_for_founders_Bessemer_Venture_Partners_2026.pdf), [Gartner enterprise AI coding agents market guide 2026](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/enterprise-ai-coding-agent-market).
- Goal: Explain why AI products need hard ROI, healthy unit economics, and workflow/data defensibility as coding agents make custom internal software easier to build.
- Outline:
  - Open with the uncomfortable buyer shift: more companies will ask, "Why buy the whole platform if my team can build the 30% we actually need with coding agents?"
  - Combine ROI clarity and unit economics: activity metrics are weak; durable value should connect to cycle time, support cost, conversion, retention, margin, revenue per employee, or reduced implementation cost.
  - Show the AI margin trap: inference, retrieval, retries, evals, monitoring, and human review can turn popular features into negative-margin workflows if pricing stays seat-based or usage is unbounded.
  - Develop the moat argument: generic AI features are copyable; defensibility shifts to proprietary workflow data, deep integrations, operational memory, trust, eval datasets, distribution, and ownership of a business process.
  - Practical takeaway: an "AI value equation" requiring business outcome, cost per completed workflow, pricing model, switching cost, and a 90-day clone test.

### p1-04 The Talent Mix: Why AI Adoption Needs Balanced Builders

- Reader/job: CTOs, engineering leaders, product leaders, and AI adoption leaders hiring or coaching teams that will build with AI.
- Evidence/resources: [McKinsey technology workforce for the AI-first era 2026](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-technology/our-insights/designing-an-end-to-end-technology-workforce-for-the-ai-first-era), [BCG Invest in Your People 2025](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/to-unlock-the-full-value-of-ai-invest-in-your-people), [Gallup AI adopters and holdouts 2026](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/704252/workplace-separates-adopters-holdouts.aspx), [Sonar verification gap in AI coding 2026](https://www.sonarsource.com/company/press-releases/sonar-data-reveals-critical-verification-gap-in-ai-coding/).
- Goal: Define the balanced AI-era employee: neither reckless early adopter nor fear-driven holdout, but a builder who uses AI actively while preserving judgment, verification, security, and customer responsibility.
- Outline:
  - Use the existing fear/adoption articles to frame the human tension: fear is rational, but disengagement leaves teams behind; enthusiasm is useful, but blind acceleration creates quality and trust risk.
  - Show why AI-native teams need mixed capability: product judgment, domain knowledge, data engineering, platform/infra, security, evals, customer implementation, and workflow design.
  - Contrast the two failure profiles: the overly eager engineer who ships untrusted AI shortcuts, and the fear-driven engineer who avoids the tools and loses leverage.
  - Turn adoption into management practice: pair skeptics with AI-forward builders, require verification and tests, create show-and-tell loops, document safe patterns, and reward measured business impact over tool usage.
  - Practical takeaway: a balanced-builder scorecard covering AI fluency, skepticism, verification discipline, workflow thinking, security judgment, and customer empathy.
